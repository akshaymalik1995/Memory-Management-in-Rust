# Memory Management in Rust: A 10-Part Tutorial Series

Welcome to the "Memory Management in Rust" tutorial series! This series is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Rust's unique approach to memory management, a cornerstone of its ability to guarantee memory safety without a garbage collector.

Whether you are new to Rust or looking to solidify your understanding of its memory model, this series will guide you through the core concepts, from ownership and borrowing to smart pointers and even the intricacies of `unsafe` Rust.

## Target Audience

This tutorial is aimed at learners who have:
*   Basic programming knowledge.
*   Some familiarity with systems programming concepts (though not strictly required).
*   A desire to understand how Rust achieves memory safety and performance.

## Tutorial Parts

The series is broken down into 10 parts, each covering a specific aspect of memory management in Rust. It is recommended to go through them in order.

1.  **[Part 1: Introduction to Ownership](./01_introduction_to_ownership.md)**
    *   Understanding Rustâ€™s ownership model, rules of ownership, the `String` type, moving, copying, cloning, scope, and an introduction to how ownership relates to functions.
2.  **[Part 2: Borrowing and References](./02_borrowing_and_references.md)**
    *   Understanding references, immutable borrows, mutable borrows, rules of borrowing, and dangling references.
3.  **[Part 3: Lifetimes](./03_lifetimes.md)**
    *   Understanding lifetime basics, lifetime elision rules, explicit lifetime annotations in functions and structs, the `'static` lifetime, and common lifetime patterns and errors.
4.  **[Part 4: Memory Allocation: Stack vs. Heap](./04_stack_vs_heap.md)**
    *   Understanding how Rust allocates memory on the stack and the heap, which data goes where, and the performance implications.
5.  **[Part 5: Smart Pointers](./05_smart_pointers.md)**
    *   Introduction to smart pointers, `Box<T>` for heap allocation, `Rc<T>` for reference counting, `Arc<T>` for atomic reference counting, and the `Deref` trait.
6.  **[Part 6: Interior Mutability](./06_interior_mutability.md)**
    *   Understanding the concept of interior mutability, `Cell<T>`, `RefCell<T>`, and runtime borrow checking.
7.  **[Part 7: Memory Leaks in Rust](./07_memory_leaks.md)**
    *   How memory leaks can occur (e.g., reference cycles with `Rc<T>` and `RefCell<T>`), and using `Weak<T>` to prevent them.
8.  **[Part 8: The Drop Trait and Custom Cleanup](./08_drop_trait.md)**
    *   Understanding the `Drop` trait for custom resource deallocation and cleanup logic when values go out of scope.
9.  **[Part 9: Venturing into unsafe Rust](./09_unsafe_rust.md)**
    *   Understanding what `unsafe` Rust is, its "superpowers" (like dereferencing raw pointers, calling unsafe functions), and the responsibilities that come with writing `unsafe` code.
10. **[Part 10: Memory Management Patterns & Best Practices](./10_patterns_and_best_practices.md)**
    *   Review of key concepts, common patterns for safe and efficient memory management, idiomatic Rust for handling resources, performance considerations, and final thoughts on achieving memory safety.

## How to Use This Tutorial

*   Read each part sequentially, as concepts often build upon previous ones.
*   Try out the code examples. Experiment by modifying them to see how the Rust compiler reacts.
*   Complete the exercises at the end of each part to solidify your understanding.

We hope this series helps you master memory management in Rust and write safer, more efficient code!
